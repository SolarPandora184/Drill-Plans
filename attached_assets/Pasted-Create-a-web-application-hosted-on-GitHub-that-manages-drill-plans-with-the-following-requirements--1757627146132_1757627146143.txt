Create a web application hosted on GitHub that manages drill plans with the following requirements:

Users can upload drill plans, and each scheduled drill plan must include:

A date (required).

Flight assignment: Alpha Flight, Tango Flight, or Both Flights.

Association with a drill command selected from a dropdown list (with the ability to create new commands).

Type of event: Drill movement or Class.

Option to upload one or more files.

Notes (optional, and can be added at creation or later).

Drill plans are displayed on a calendar view:

Multiple drill plans can exist on the same date.

Each calendar block clearly shows which flight it applies to and whether it is a class or drill movement.

Past and upcoming events are visually differentiated.

Clicking a calendar block displays all details for that drill plan, including:

Scheduled date and flight.

Drill command name and type.

Full notes history, with the ability to add new notes.

Uploaded files, with options to preview or download them.

Ability to edit any of the fields.

Ability to duplicate the plan to another date.

Navigation to previous or next iterations of that command.

Drill command dropdown requirements:

Lists all created commands.

When a command is selected, the system duplicates it onto the new scheduled date, carrying over its metadata and notes history.

The dropdown list itself never contains duplicates.

For each command, the user can view when it was last executed by Alpha Flight and when it was last executed by Tango Flight.

Ability to view the most recent occurrence of any command:

Shows the date, associated notes, and uploaded files.

Option to download or duplicate the command to a new date.

Option to step back through earlier iterations of that command.

Drill commands can also be created separately, with:

A name.

Type (Drill or Class).

Optional uploaded files.

Associated metadata.

Once created, they appear in the dropdown list.

Export feature:

Export to an Excel file with a separate worksheet for each flight.

Drill plans marked as “Both Flights” appear in both worksheets.

Worksheets must clearly separate past and upcoming plans by date.

Each row includes the date, command name, type, notes summary, file names, and links to files.

Database management constraint:

The database may not exceed 1 GB.

When the limit is approached, the system must automatically prune data by deleting the oldest scheduled iterations until space is recovered.

The newest iteration for each command must always be preserved.

The system should only delete the minimum amount required and leave a small buffer under the 1 GB limit.

All code, files, and hosting must be managed entirely in a GitHub repository.
